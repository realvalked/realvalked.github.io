Lightweight webapp I made for automatically resizing and optimizing images and gifs for the O3C.
<br>
I made this because i've grown tired of manually doing it every time I wanted to change the image</a>!
<br>
Currently WIP. Will also work on adding gifs and images made by the community, not sure how that will work out though.
